Dude, just got out of Karate Kid: Legends and my brain’s kinda buzzing in a million different directions. There's still this whisper of static in my ears from the noisy theater, like an old radio that can't quite get the signal right. I swear my back needs a chiropractor, those seats are like medieval torture devices but with less charm. 

Anyway, back to the  , it opens with this epic montage of mad crazy training sequences – felt like I was 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 energy directly into my eyes. Seriously, the kicks were like poetry in motion. Jackie Chan actually looked like he was flying. I wonder if that’s what migraine tablets see when they dream. The popcorn crumbs are sticking to my fingers; I probably look like a disappointed toddler discovering that sand isn't sugar.

> Jaden Smith's character, oh boy. One scene he's this quiet brooding type, next he's like a sunflower on steroids. It's that journey, you know, from zero to hero. Makes me think of those software updates promising bug fixes but just end up reshuffling the bugs. There's a part where he's standing under a waterfall - it's supposed to be all profound and zen, but all I could think about was that 𝘦𝘱𝘪𝘴𝘰𝘥𝘦 of Friends where Joey gets the supposedly fake rain rigged and catch pneumonia. 

In one of the fights, there was this slo-mo bit where a foot met a face like an old friend giving a surprise slap. The impact was like when you press 'enter' on a code you definitely forgot to double-check and you just 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦ze, mid-coffee sip, expecting chaos. God, the energy in that theater was peanuts and flying soda cups, I tell you.

Oh! Someone just texted me asking if they should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   - thought I'd just throw that in because, yeah, totally worth 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 with all the kung-fu energy live in your face. It's like 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 a new perspective on ass-kicking, neatly wrapped in a package of existential teabags.

>> Random sidenote: the colors in the   were mad, like someone finally managed to perfectly mix fruit punch into a sunset. Why does the flickering of those neon lights remind me of debugging a network issue under those gross fluorescent lights at work? And, oh man, the soundtrack... it was like my playlist decided to quit the treadmill and climb Everest.

fn main() {
   char ptr = What;
   if (undefined_behavior) {
      printf(%s, ptr);
      return -1;
   }
/ What does this even compile?/
   return 0;
}
